# usebitcoins: Payment Processing With Bitcoin

WORK IN PROGRESS. DO NOT TRY RUNNING THIS IN PRODUCTION. I HOLD NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU LOSING MONEY.

usebitcoins lets you collect payments in Bitcoin. usebitcoins exposes
a server and an API to automate every step of receiving Bitcoin
payments. If you are developing anything from an e-commerce site for
alpaca socks to a vending machine, the goal is for usebitcoins to be a
lightweight component of your system so convenient you wouldn't want
to use a third-party processor. Think of it like Stripe for Bitcoin
but it's fully open source and hosted by you.
